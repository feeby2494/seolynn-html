				<h2>Suspension Setups for 8th Gen Corolla</h2>
        <p>Currently, my car rides on KYB gr2's and Manzo lowering springs. Manzo's are less than a $100 on ebay and are susposedly
        made by Megan Racing without factory warrenty. Before installing these springs, my front end has a huge wheel gap,
        while the back end had only a slight gap. This made the front higher than the back, which made my car look like
        a clown car.</p>
        <img alt="before lowered">
        <img alt="after lowered">
        <p>As you can see, these springs made the front and back more even with each other with less gap between wheel and fender.
        The ride became more stiff, bouncy, and every bit of road can be felt. This did make it harder to keep up with traffic
        nearby rail road tracks and speed bumps. You will have to slow down to at least 3rd grear for railroad crossings,
        if not lower for speed bumps. </p>

        <p>The drivers of Dallas are some of the worst too. They drive really fast and wreckless like
        they just got their driver's licenses yesterday. They have already hit me from behind! Hopefully, your area deosn't have
        ubnoxicus <strike>teenagers</strike> middle-aged insecure people who need to buy the newest car every year to keep up with
        the status que. If you love your car be conscious of what's going on behind you and never file a claim with insurance.
        They will declare your car an instant loss due to bullshit reasons (age and mileage) and sale your car to a salvage yard!
        We unfornatly don't get anything when in a wreck, so cancel your collison coverage, it's wrothless.</p>
